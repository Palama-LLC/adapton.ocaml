This directory contains some sample apps that make use of Adapton.

Each should be built (ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind rootfile.native) after pinning Adapton to opam.
For an example of code integrated with the source files instead, see Source/test and myocamlbuild.ml

'Trivial' demonstrates access to the adapton library.
