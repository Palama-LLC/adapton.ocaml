OOPSLA '15 results data
=======================

This directory contains the original list processing 
datasets used in the submission of
  
    Incremental Computation with Names

To OOPSLA '15. CSV files are the results of running
our script/test-oopsla15.sh. The experiments.xslx
spreadsheet is our worksheet for calculations while
determining what would get into the actual submission.

The spreadsheet is active, and parameter changes result
in recalculations of summaries, if the relevent data is
present in the raw data sheet.

This directory is not a snapshot, but has been cleaned
up somewhat for presentation. Unused data was removed
and the script was modified to reflect this.

We have also included the results of our IMP interpreter
tests, from Table 2 of the paper.
